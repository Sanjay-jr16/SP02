# spo2 dev board
The SPO₂ Sensor Board is a compact and efficient device designed to measure blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂) and heart rate using optical sensing technology, typically through a sensor like the MAX30100 or MAX30102.
It interfaces easily with microcontrollers such as Arduino, ESP32, or STM32 via I2C, and includes onboard voltage regulation and signal filtering for stable performance.
Powering options include 3.3V or 5V depending on sensor configuration, and accurate readings require secure sensor placement with minimal ambient light interference.
Users can visualize data via a serial monitor or display, and example firmware, schematics, and layout files are typically provided to help get started quickly.
